            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was late 2019. I was bored out of my skull, waiting for DJ Coco to fix up a build for <em>Paperball</em> so I could get back on testing, but I didn't feel like working on any particularly big project at the time. I looked around my hard drive looking for anything to do and found some old mock-up graphics I made for an old, abandoned project. A feeling of nostalgia immediately washed over me.</p>
<p>Back in 2013, me and DJ Coco had plans for a 2D platformer named <em>Rad Dude</em>. <em>Shovel Knight</em> was busy blowing up Kickstarter at the time, and in turn, we were inspired to try and make a sidescroller of our own. It would be an 8-bit love letter to all those old, bizarrely localized games on the NES that felt the need to shove in <strong>MACHO DUDES</strong>, <strong>BADNESS</strong> and everything else <strong>GNARLY</strong> about the 80s. It starred the titular Rad Dude and his best friend, Cool Chick, as they rocked denim clothes and used all kinds of crazy gadgets to rescue the city from an evil toymaker.</p>
<p><img src="https://vertette.github.io/img/raddude_0.png" alt="Rad Dude concept art" />
<em>I'm rad.</em></p>
<p>I'll spare you the details because, well, there wasn't much more to it than that. DJ Coco quickly abandoned the project after it became clear that the idea was lacking, which angered and saddened me quite a bit. In hindsight, <em>Rad Dude</em> was clearly not going to be anything special. We didn't actually have much experience, money or vision for the game, so it never really had a chance to be anything good with the level of our skills back then. At the time, though, I didn't see it that way. I felt betrayed by my best friend as I thought we were truly onto something. In the end, with not much progress having been made on the game itself, all I was left with was a bunch of ideas and some mock-up graphics as the both of us moved on to other projects.</p>
<p>I took those same old <em>Rad Dude</em> graphics six years later and saved over them, not even caring to keep a back-up of it anywhere. With Mario on my mind at the time - Mario being the first thing I'll draw if I want to draw but don't know what to draw - I mutilated the old pixel art to turn it into an ersatz version of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, and suddenly an idea sprang in my mind: I could use these graphics to make a small joke game that would look and feel like a Chinese bootleg developer made their own take on the classic Mario games.</p>
<p><img src="https://vertette.github.io/img/shi_early_0.png" alt="Early Salaryman Shi concept art" />
<em>Before...</em></p>
<p>I sent the mock-up to DJ Coco, expecting him to find it as funny as I did. Instead, he was unimpressed. &quot;It's pretty on the nose&quot;, he said. &quot;Yeah, that's the point,&quot; I explained. &quot;It's going to be like a bootleg Mario, glitching out at times and whatnot. It'd be funny.&quot; &quot;Honestly, that sounds kinda boring,&quot; he shot back. &quot;I would just rethink the entire idea.&quot; And so I went back to the drawing board, trying to figure out what to do with this mock-up. I did another search through my hard-drive and, by luck, stumbled onto yet another old abandoned project of mine. Suddenly, it hit me. I started giggling, then chuckling, then I burst out in laughter. It was stupid, it was hilarious and it had lots of potential.</p>
<p>After <em>Rad Dude</em>'s death, I started making a game in <em>RPG Maker VX Ace</em>. I had an obsession with <em>Takeshi no Chosenjo</em> at the time and wanted to make something with a similar style and tone, and so I named my game <em>Takeshi's Second Challenge</em>. It would be an RPG starring a salaryman named Takeshi Shi, and it was going to be somewhat unique in that you could only raise stats or earn money by doing minigames. You would increase your stats by working out at the gym and make money by doing various odd jobs. Combine that with the obligatory <em>Dragon Quest</em>-esque battles and a dark, surreal sense of humor and I ended up with a prototype that was surprisingly fun for what it was. (And yes, I do like <em>No More Heroes</em>.)</p>
<p><img src="https://vertette.github.io/img/takeshisc_0.png" alt="Takeshi's Second Challenge screenshot" />
<em>I had to hook up my old PC to take a screenshot of this.</em></p>
<p>The problem with <em>Takeshi's Second Challenge</em>, however, is that while I loved the idea, I didn't have the programming or art skills to do the idea justice. While it was fun to work in RPG Maker to try to push the limits of the engine as far as I could, I quickly ran into issues as the scope of the game became too big for me to handle. I didn't know how to program the engine into doing what I wanted it to do, didn't have the art skills to make it look as good as I envisioned it to be and didn't have the budget to compensate for either of these shortcomings. That's why I reluctantly decided to shelf the game indefinitely, planning to return to the game one day in the future.</p>
<p>And so, years later, I sketched up a bored looking Takeshi Shi, some boxes, a ladder and some bills, put them into the mock-up and sent the result to DJ Coco, who couldn't stop laughing either. We quickly started throwing ideas around: how the game would play, what kind of power-ups it would have, what the goal would be and so on. It didn't take long until we agreed to turn this into a real game after he was done developing <em>Paperball</em>, which we were sure wouldn't take that long. An actual <strong>year and a half</strong> later, after various patches, three DLC packs and a <em>Nintendo Switch</em> port, we would finally begin work on <em>Salaryman Shi</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://vertette.github.io/img/shi_early_1.png" alt="Early Salaryman Shi concept art" />
<em>...and after.</em></p>
<p>As you can see, the game was originally going to be 8-bit just like <em>Rad Dude</em>, but I quickly changed my mind on this for two simple reasons: 1) it's boring and 2) %&amp;$#ing stop it already. Shi could never hope to stand out in the ocean of identical looking 2D 8-bit platformers on <em>Steam</em>. I started experimenting with making a 16-bit art style for the game, which is the first time I tried to draw actual 16-bit art that wasn't just replicating another game's art style, but my earliest attempts were so bad DJ Coco rejected them on the spot. That was surprising, as he can be harsh, but he's usually not <em>that</em> harsh. He suggested simply going back to an 8-bit style, but I was too stubborn to do that. I knew I had it in me to challenge myself and put out a game that would, at the very least, not embarass me with its visuals.</p>
<p><img src="https://vertette.github.io/img/shi_early_2.png" alt="Early Salaryman Shi concept art" />
<em>How are you going to accomplish that? Definitely not like this. Yuck.</em></p>
<p>Yet the longer I tried to develop Shi's art style, the more I felt frustrated at myself. I knew I was capable of at least putting out competent art, but it still wasn't clicking for me. All the art I was putting out was garbage. I tried various different drawing tools just to see if something would change, and that's when the light bulb finally blinked on: the only times I've ever tried to make pixel art more complex than in an NES game is when I was working on ROM hacks. Somehow, that was the big difference. I installed YY-CHR and Lunar Magic, started putting a palette together and quickly drew up a few mock-ups after. I showed the results to DJ Coco, who said: &quot;looks OK but could be a bit more original&quot;. Now we were finally getting somewhere.</p>
<p><img src="https://vertette.github.io/img/shi_early_3.png" alt="Early Salaryman Shi concept art" />
<em>That's right, there was a time where Shi looked even more like Super Mario World.</em></p>
<p>In that sense, <em>Salaryman Shi</em>'s look isn't just accurate to 16-bit era visuals, it <em>works on actual 16-bit hardware</em>. Outside of the use of a few transformative effects (which could still be replicated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_FX">Super FX chip</a>), everything about it works with the real SNES's limits: the RGB values, the amount of colors per palette row and total palette rows, even the amount of VRAM dictacting how many unique tiles can be used at a given time. I could rave about this stuff for hours, but I'll spare you from the exact technical details. TL;DGAF: Shi's art works on the SNES.</p>
<p>Now the obvious question is, why would I go through all that trouble for something that's so trivial that nobody will ever notice and/or appreciate it? The answer might surprise you - it's because it made it easier to draw. The paradox of limitations is that, when you set some hard limitations for yourself, it becomes easier to be creative. After all, having no limitations at all means anything is on the table. Limitations, on the other hand, make it very easy to determine what you can and can't do. As an indie developer who's seen dozens of people burn themselves out with crazy ambitious ideas and scope creep, I've found that not many artists in this industry embrace their limitations. They get it in their head that their first game <em>needs</em> to have a scope bigger and more ambitious than they could reasonably take on. It's a mistake that, as you can reasonably assume from <em>Salaryman Shi</em>'s complicated history, I've made many times myself.</p>
<p>And yet it really doesn't have to be that way. That's the great thing about independent games: there's much less pressure to deliver something big and perfectly polished because consumers don't expect that most indie developers  have the budget for that (unless your game is priced appropiately). If it's decent, people will forgive it for not being very unique. And if it's a bit rough, people won't mind as long as you're trying something new. It really is that simple.</p>
<p><em>Salaryman Shi</em> went on to sell about 1.400 copies. That's nothing to brag about, but it was never going to be a game that'd rock the industry or something that'd change the way people look at games, and it was never meant to be. It was a small game that me and DJ Coco made in our spare time for fun. Because our plans were never that ambitious, it was easy to just keep working on it, knowing that the final game would be done Real Soon Now™. The base game ended up only taking a year to develop, with the free DLC only taking a few extra months on top, and with its budget being so low we ended up making a pretty decent profit off it.</p>
<p>If you stop thinking of limitations as what you can't do, but instead as what you <em>can</em>, everything becomes much easier.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Were <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1198510/Paperball/"><em>Paperball</em></a>'s character designs a success? It's a hard question to answer for me.</p>
<p>I remember waking up early one morning and finding a message on my phone. &quot;Vinny is playing Paperball&quot;, a friend told me. &quot;Holy crap&quot;, I replied. I rushed onto my computer to check Twitch and there it was, Vinny from Vinesauce was in fact <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ls_bRPNyes">playing <em>Paperball</em></a>, the game that I had been helping my best friend <a href="https://twitter.com/CliaxGamesCoco/">DJ Coco</a> develop for the past year or so.</p>
<p>It was a surreal moment to say the least, seeing a streamer I loved so much play a game I've been involved with, but even weirder was all the attention we suddenly got. Cliax Games never really had a huge audience, so this was new for us. We got a bunch of fan art, some of it affectionate and some of it tongue in cheek, but more important was all the feedback we received. &quot;It looks low budget&quot;, yeah, I mean, it was. &quot;It's a bit slow&quot;, that's fair, something to consider for next time? &quot;Where's the pants&quot;, &quot;why doesn't she wear pants&quot;, &quot;why is the cat wearing FMB boots&quot;, &quot;no pants&quot;...</p>
<p>Looks like I made a mistake.</p>
<p>Back in late 2018, DJ Coco showed me a screenshot of the game he was working on. He called it <em>Paperball</em>, and he said it was inspired by the <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> games, which he is a big fan of. He explained that, as the series hadn't seen a mainline game in years, he wanted to make his own successor with some additional mechanics from games like <em>Trackmania</em>. It was probably gonna be a small game, 50 levels at most, but it should be a fun little side-project. &quot;Cool&quot;, I said. I was either distracted or unimpressed at the time. Probably both.</p>
<p>The more he showed me of <em>Paperball</em>, however, the more I realized something. <em>Monkey Ball</em> was considered dead at the time, another sad relic of Sega's better days among franchises like <em>Jet Set Radio</em> and <em>Crazy Taxi</em>. There were other marble rollers on the market like <em>Marble Blast Ultra</em>, but all of them missed that arcade-like simplicity that made <em>Monkey Ball</em> such a fun game to pick up and play, and <em>Rolled Out</em> hadn't even launched its <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/rolled-out/">IndieGoGo campaign</a> yet. That gave me an idea.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to help you market the game&quot;, I told DJ Coco. &quot;This is a game which could definitely fill a hole no other game on the market does right now, and if marketed in the right way, I can see it selling very well. Thousands of copies, with some luck. The first thing we need, though, is a mascot. You can't market a game with a paper ball for a mascot.&quot; &quot;Yeah yeah, I know&quot;, he said, &quot;'don't worry, I'll whip up something.&quot; He showed me his something a few weeks later.</p>
<p><img src="https://vertette.github.io/img/coco_0.png" alt="Early Coco concept art" />
<em>A Coco that never was, thankfully.</em></p>
<p>I don't remember what I said, but I'm sure it had to involve insults of some kind because this design still haunts me. &quot;What are you going for here?&quot;, I remember asking. &quot;What are any of these elements supposed to communicate? Why is she even wearing a graduation cap?&quot; &quot;Because she's an art college student&quot;, DJ Coco explained. &quot;But she hasn't graduated yet&quot;, I replied with some bafflement. &quot;And why the gloves, or giant bell, or striped tail, or those socks?&quot;</p>
<p>He couldn't really explain any of his creative decisions, which isn't a good sign. He was inspired by the design of the shopkeeper in <em>Blinx: The Time Sweeper</em>, he told me later, but failed to bring the design together in any way that would communicate anything about this character.</p>
<p>&quot;Right&quot;, I said. &quot;I'm redoing this stupid thing, because there's no way you will sell anything with a mascot that looks like this. This bright pink is dreadful, let's give her a blue shirt and hot pink pants instead. Let's give her a beret and scarf to show she's an art student, and get rid of the gloves and all the stripes because it just makes the design too busy. Just keep the tip white.&quot; I sent a picture of what I came up with to DJ Coco, and while he was happy with the result, he insisted on adding boots and a cat bell to the end of the scarf. &quot;Sure, that's fine&quot;, I replied.</p>
<p><img src="https://vertette.github.io/img/coco_1.png" alt="Later Coco concept art" />
<em>A Coco that sorta was.</em></p>
<p>It is entirely my fault that I never stressed the pants more, as I drew the shirt over the pants in my initial drawing and DJ Coco used that as a reference for the concept art that we would end up sending to the actual 2D artist. At the time, I figured it wasn't a big deal because she's a cartoon cat, and anthromorphic cartoons almost exclusively dress in halves anyway. I'm sure it's due to the game's 2D art looking more anime-inspired than I had envisioned that it became such a focal point, but by the time I realized this it was too late to object.</p>
<p>Some credit has to go to the 2D artist, though, for simplifying the design's face and giving her some eyebrows as it helped a lot with expressions. I don't know who made the suggestion to turn the bell red, but it ended up reminding everyone of Pokéballs so while it ties in well with the design of the playable ball itself, we probably should've kept the pink. Thankfully, Nintendo has never had any legal objections to our games so far, which I admit sorta surprises me.</p>
<p>The name was easier to figure out, defying industry conventions. &quot;Let's call her Coco the Cat&quot;, I said. &quot;It's short, it fits the character's slightly ditzy personality and it works with the <em>Monkey Ball</em> naming conventions. AiAi, Baby, Coco and so on.&quot; &quot;Don't you think people would assume we just named her after me?&quot;, DJ Coco asked. &quot;Eh, that's not a big deal. You created the game, and she created the <em>Paperball</em> art project in-game, it fits.&quot; And that was that.</p>
<p>The game released on March 27th 2020 and ended up surpassing our expectations quite a bit. Part of that is due to a lot of luck: I had contacted various YouTubers and streamers, ones I knew were big <em>Monkey Ball</em> fans, to ask if they wanted a copy. Some of them actually replied and ended up streaming the game, raising a lot of awareness, and as a result other YouTubers and streamers ended up actually contacting <em>us</em> to ask for a copy. That was a first.</p>
<p><img src="https://vertette.github.io/img/djgray_0.png" alt="Betty from DJ Gray" />
<em><a href="https://djgraycomic.com/comic/dj-gray-page-303/">In an alternate universe</a>, Paperball sold well enough to get merchandise.</em></p>
<p>Of course, these days just releasing a game doesn't mean you're done with it, not by a long shot, so it didn't take long until plans for post-release content were made. The initial plan was to develop one new game mode and two new DLC packs, with their own art, gimmicks and environments, but just like with the main game - which launched with three times as many levels as planned - DJ Coco's scope got bigger and bigger, so I ended up having to design three new outfits for the DLC packs.</p>
<p>(Fun fact: Blitz Mode - named after <em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz</em>, which infamously added a jump - and Flip Mode - where you try to control one ball with two players - were my ideas. I suggested them as jokes, and DJ Coco ended up implementing both. I should have known better as he had similarly added the Fallout Royale achievement, unlocked by getting 76.000 fallouts, based on a <em>Fallout 76</em> joke I made before release. I don't make jokes around him anymore.)</p>
<p><img src="https://vertette.github.io/img/coco_2.png" alt="Coco's DLC outfits concept art" />
<em>In my defense, some people pay good money to dress up anthromorphic characters.</em></p>
<p>The new outfits were a cakewalk to design in comparison to Coco's original design. The toughest part was already done, so I just had to draw some new outfits. I originally wanted to go with a more 60's kitschy kind of look for the Secret Spy outfit, but it was too hard to draw and didn't really fit the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1209620/Paperball__Secret_Spy_Pack/">environment of the pack</a> so I ended up going with something more muted with a touch of pink. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1209621/Paperball__Deep_Sea_Pack/">mermaid</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285150/Paperball__Cherry_Sky_Pack/">kimono</a> outfits were even easier as they're admittedly not particularly inspired designs, although DJ Coco did have to &quot;motivate&quot; me to finish them on time by drawing intentionally bad art and threatening to send it to the 2D artist.</p>
<p>What was trickier to figure out were the poses - I didn't want each pack to just have the same art with a new costume slapped on top, so I had to think hard of some new ones that would still fit the character. My initial suggestion for the Deep Sea pack's game over pose was Coco getting jabbed in the back by a fishing hook, but DJ Coco didn't like how violent it looked even if depicted in a cartoony way, so it became more of a hook entrapment. I feel it's a weaker pose, but it was probably the right call.</p>
<p>It was during the summer of 2020, right during development of the DLC, that we were trying to bring <em>Paperball</em> to Nintendo Switch. We applied to Nintendo's developer program and got rejected, and with both us and the fans wanting to see the game appear on the platform, it seemed there was no real other way than to get a publisher. The company we had gotten in contact with had a good reputation and saw potential in the game, but they insisted on a five dollar price tag and a large cut of the profits (which according to my knowledge now was actually <strong>below average</strong>).</p>
<p>Between the publisher, the platform and taxes we would've seen maybe half a dollar per sale, and for how much work the game ended up being, that just didn't seem worth it. During the talks, we ended up applying to Nintendo again and somehow got approved this time. While their reasons for changing their mind are still beyond me, it was now official - <em>Paperball</em> was getting a Nintendo Switch release. But how do we incentivize people to double dip?</p>
<p><img src="https://vertette.github.io/img/chrissy_0.png" alt="Chrissy concept art" />
<em>Of course! We add more furry cats! Cliax Games, you've done it again.</em></p>
<p>DJ Coco came up with a plan: we would release the new patch with extra content and DLC packs in September 2020, and then continue working on the Nintendo Switch port, hopefully being done around January 2021 with a release in March, one year after the original game. The idea was to release the port under the name <em>Paperball Deluxe</em>, including all the DLC and some timed console-exclusive content: a new pack of levels with new world themes, music, gimmicks and a new mascot character, which I volunteered to design.</p>
<p>After all the feedback we got on regular <em>Paperball</em>, I felt a bit more self-aware about designing something good for <em>Paperball Deluxe</em>. My first thought was to make a hippie character, as the new levels were going to be sunflower themed, so it seemed fitting enough. I ended up doing a lot more research - both into hippie fashion and character design - for the final character design, which ended up taking a lot of inspiration from various places: the sunflower headband and the beads were inspired by some photos I found, the yellow jacket was inspired by Athena Cykes from <em>Ace Attorney</em>, and the boots were something I threw in because I wanted some earthy colors in there.</p>
<p>I presented DJ Coco with the three designs you see above, and he chose the green palette for tying in well with the sunflower theme. I agreed, for both that reason and because the yellow and green contrasts well against Coco's pink and blue. The only touch-up I made after this was increasing the color contrast and giving her a brown belt as I felt something was missing, and it tied the boots in better with the rest of the design. DJ Coco named her Chrissy (get it? Chris and Coco?), and that was that. <em>Paperball Deluxe</em> ended up releasing March 25th 2021, using that exact design.</p>
<p><img src="https://vertette.github.io/img/chrissy_1.png" alt="Chrissy's final design" />
<em>The loose hanging belt and shaggy hair also helped sell Chrissy as more of a slob than her sister. In a game where you don't have much time to show the character's personalities, every tiny bit counts.</em></p>
<p>I was a lot happier with Chrissy's design for many reasons, the biggest one being she's not pantsless. The second biggest reason is that her design simply is a lot stronger. Her design communicates her personality much better than Coco's, while still wearing an outfit that looks like something a real person would actually wear. The only big mistake I made was the peace necklace, which I forgot should have three lines near the bottom instead of two. Nobody except DJ Coco ever pointed this out, though, and it took him years to realize. My headcanon is that Chrissy bought it from some cheap vendor and was too dumb to notice. Man, how embarrassing would that be!</p>
<p>(On a side note, I was also very happy with Chrissy's voice work. Coco and Chrissy are both voiced by <a href="https://twitter.com/AimeeSmithVA">Aimee Smith</a>, an absolute sweetheart of a woman who has done voicework for many notable games, and also <em>Paperball</em>. She nailed Coco's voice, which sounds appropiately bubbly, but we weren't sure if she could do the voice we had in mind for Chrissy. We gave her a few notes - Chrissy was a more laid-back old sister character with a whispery voice, and asked her if she thought she could do it. She ended up delivering the exact voice we wanted, much to our delight.)</p>
<p>So, to go back to my question at the beginning. Were the designs a success? My thoughts on the matter are complex, but I can't deny that, at the end of the day, the characters helped sell <em>Paperball</em>. I've seen people replying to fan art online expressing their interest in the game, and I've read reviews that admit they bought the game entirely because of the designs. That's what good designs should do, really, so the short answer is: yes, with a but.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my blog, my name is Christopher Stephens. By day I do boring IT work, by night I work on games. I've worked on games like <em>Paperball</em>, <em>Salaryman Shi</em> and <em>Onlink</em>. (They're not very well known so don't think you've been living under a rock if you've never heard of them.) This blog is where I'll put up articles discussing and/or analyzing video games from a developer's perspective. Some of the games I'll talk about will be ones I've been involved with developing, though not all of them.</p>
<p>I've been meaning to write down all the thoughts I've had about games over the years instead of bothering my friends with them. For the longest time I've been tempted to start making YouTube videos, actually, but writing takes up a lot less time and effort, plus there's no risk of Google's faulty bots slapping me around this way. Hopefully someone on the internet still appreciates written material, and hopefully some of these articles will inform and/or entertain you.</p>
<p>I'll try to write something every two weeks at the very least, but we'll see how that turns out.</p>]]></content:encoded>
